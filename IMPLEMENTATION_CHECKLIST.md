# Backend Stripe Integration - Implementation Checklist

## ✅ Core Implementation

### Stripe SDK Configuration
- [x] Added `stripe` package (v17.x) to dependencies
- [x] Created `/backend/src/config/stripe.ts` with lazy initialization
- [x] Configured API version locking (2025-09-30.clover)
- [x] Added environment variable validation for Stripe keys
- [x] Created STRIPE_CONFIG with price ID, webhook secret, and redirect URLs

### Database Models
- [x] Extended User model with `stripeCustomerId` and `stripeSubscriptionId` fields
- [x] Created WebhookEvent model for idempotency tracking
- [x] Added TTL index (30 days) to WebhookEvent for automatic cleanup
- [x] Updated model exports in `/backend/src/models/index.ts`

### Services
- [x] Created BillingService (`/backend/src/services/billing.service.ts`):
  - [x] `createCheckoutSession()` - Creates Stripe checkout session
  - [x] `handleWebhookEvent()` - Processes webhook events with idempotency
  - [x] `constructWebhookEvent()` - Validates webhook signatures
  - [x] `handleCheckoutCompleted()` - Upgrades user to pro, resets usage
  - [x] `handleSubscriptionDeleted()` - Downgrades user to free
  - [x] `handlePaymentFailed()` - Logs payment failures
- [x] Extended UserService (`/backend/src/services/user.service.ts`):
  - [x] `updateStripeCustomerId()` - Stores customer ID
  - [x] `updateSubscription()` - Updates plan and subscription ID
  - [x] `findByStripeCustomerId()` - Finds user by customer ID

### Controllers
- [x] Created BillingController (`/backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.ts`):
  - [x] `createCheckoutSession` - POST /api/billing/checkout
  - [x] `handleWebhook` - POST /api/upgrade with signature validation

### Routes
- [x] Created `/backend/src/routes/billing.routes.ts` - Billing routes
- [x] Created `/backend/src/routes/upgrade.routes.ts` - Webhook endpoint
- [x] Updated `/backend/src/routes/index.ts` to include new routes

### Middleware Updates
- [x] Modified `/backend/src/app.ts` to preserve raw body for webhook signature verification
- [x] Verified quota middleware refreshes user from DB (real-time plan updates)
- [x] Updated usage controller to fetch fresh user data

## ✅ API Endpoints

### POST /api/billing/checkout
- [x] Requires authentication (Bearer token)
- [x] Creates/reuses Stripe customer
- [x] Creates checkout session with configured price ID
- [x] Returns session ID and checkout URL
- [x] Stores customer ID on user record

### POST /api/upgrade
- [x] Validates Stripe webhook signature
- [x] Handles `checkout.session.completed` event
- [x] Handles `customer.subscription.deleted` event
- [x] Handles `invoice.payment_failed` event
- [x] Implements idempotency via WebhookEvent tracking
- [x] Updates user plan and usage count accordingly

## ✅ Testing

### Test Suite (`/backend/src/__tests__/billing.test.ts`)
- [x] Test checkout session creation for new customer
- [x] Test checkout session reuses existing customer
- [x] Test authentication requirement
- [x] Test webhook handling for checkout.session.completed
- [x] Test webhook handling for customer.subscription.deleted
- [x] Test webhook handling for invoice.payment_failed
- [x] Test idempotency (duplicate event rejection)
- [x] Test signature validation requirement
- [x] Test real-time plan updates in usage endpoint
- [x] All 49 tests passing

### Test Environment
- [x] Added Stripe environment variables to test setup
- [x] Mocked Stripe SDK in tests
- [x] Used proper TypeScript type assertions for Stripe events

## ✅ Documentation

### Backend README (`/backend/README.md`)
- [x] Added Stripe configuration section
- [x] Documented environment variables (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PRICE_ID, etc.)
- [x] Added comprehensive Stripe setup guide:
  - [x] Product and price creation
  - [x] Local development webhook setup with Stripe CLI
  - [x] Production webhook configuration
  - [x] Testing checkout flow
  - [x] Test card numbers
- [x] Documented webhook events handled
- [x] Added API endpoint documentation

### Root README (`/README.md`)
- [x] Added Stripe setup overview
- [x] Documented environment variables
- [x] Added quick setup instructions
- [x] Added test card reference

### Additional Documentation
- [x] Created `/backend/STRIPE_INTEGRATION.md` with:
  - [x] Architecture overview
  - [x] Component descriptions
  - [x] API endpoint specifications
  - [x] Stripe dashboard setup instructions
  - [x] Testing guide
  - [x] Error handling
  - [x] Security considerations
  - [x] Future enhancement ideas

### Environment Files
- [x] Updated `/backend/.env.example` with STRIPE_PRICE_ID

## ✅ Code Quality

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- [x] ESLint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [x] All tests pass (`npm test`) - 49/49
- [x] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [x] No type errors
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] Consistent code style

## ✅ Security & Best Practices

- [x] Webhook signature validation
- [x] Idempotency for webhook events
- [x] Environment variable validation with Zod
- [x] Raw body preservation only for webhook endpoint
- [x] Authentication required for checkout endpoint
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [x] Stripe customer IDs and subscription IDs stored securely

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Met

1. ✅ Authenticated POST to checkout endpoint returns a Checkout Session URL using configured price ID
2. ✅ Webhook endpoint verifies signatures and updates user plan to `pro` on completed checkout, reverting to `free` on subscription cancellation
3. ✅ Usage limits change immediately after plan switch (reflected in `/api/usage`)
4. ✅ Tests for webhook handler run with mocked payloads and pass
5. ✅ README includes instructions for setting Stripe secrets and forwarding webhooks in development

## Summary

All requirements from the ticket have been successfully implemented and tested. The backend now has a complete Stripe integration for Pro subscription upgrades, including:

- Checkout session creation endpoint
- Webhook handling for subscription lifecycle events
- Idempotency safeguards
- Real-time plan updates
- Comprehensive testing
- Complete documentation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
