# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the monorepo.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Workflow

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies across all workspaces
npm install
```

### Running Development Servers

```bash
# Run individual services
npm run dev:extension
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:web
```

### Building

```bash
# Build individual packages
npm run build:extension
npm run build:backend
npm run build:web

# Or build all at once
npm run build:all
```

### Code Quality

Before submitting a pull request, ensure:

1. Your code passes linting: `npm run lint`
2. Your code is properly formatted: `npm run format`
3. All tests pass: `npm run test`
4. Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed with npm workspaces:

- `extension/` - Browser extension package
- `backend/` - Backend API service
- `web/` - Web dashboard application

Each package is independent but can share dependencies and code through workspace linking.

## Commit Messages

Please follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Example:
```
Add user authentication to backend

- Implement JWT token generation
- Add middleware for protected routes
- Update user model with password hashing

Fixes #123
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the relevant package documentation
3. Ensure all tests pass and code quality checks succeed
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in each package
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write meaningful variable and function names

## Adding Dependencies

To add a dependency to a specific workspace:

```bash
# Add to extension
npm install <package-name> --workspace=extension

# Add to backend
npm install <package-name> --workspace=backend

# Add to web
npm install <package-name> --workspace=web
```

For development dependencies, use the `-D` flag:

```bash
npm install <package-name> -D --workspace=backend
```
