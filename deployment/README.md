   ‚Üì
3. Backend API (Railway/Render)       ‚Üí Core services
   ‚Üì
4. Stripe Configuration               ‚Üí Payment processing
   ‚Üì
5. Web Dashboard (Vercel)             ‚Üí User interface
   ‚Üì
6. Browser Extension (Chrome Store)   ‚Üí End-user application
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before starting any deployment, ensure you have:

- [ ] All required accounts created (Railway/Render, Vercel, MongoDB Atlas, Stripe, Google Cloud, Chrome Web Store)
- [ ] CLI tools installed (Railway/Render CLI, Vercel CLI, Stripe CLI)
- [ ] Local development environment working
- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] Build process succeeds for all components
- [ ] Environment variables documented and securely stored
- [ ] Team members assigned deployment responsibilities
- [ ] Rollback procedures reviewed and understood

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Secret Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secret management tools (Railway/Render secrets, Vercel environment variables)
- Rotate secrets every 90 days
- Maintain encrypted backup of all credentials

### Network Security
- Restrict database access to application IPs only
- Use HTTPS for all public endpoints
- Configure CORS appropriately (specific origins, not `*`)
- Enable rate limiting on all public APIs

### Authentication
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets
- Enable multi-factor authentication on all service accounts
- Limit API key permissions to minimum required scope
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity

## üìä Post-Deployment Verification

After completing all deployments, verify the entire system:

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Run health check script
./deployment/verify-health.sh

# Check all services are responding
curl https://api.promptlens.app/health
curl https://dashboard.promptlens.app
```

### Manual Testing
- [ ] User can sign up with Google OAuth
- [ ] User can capture prompts from ChatGPT
- [ ] User can capture prompts from Google Gemini
- [ ] User can view prompts in dashboard
- [ ] User can upgrade to Pro via Stripe
- [ ] Webhook properly upgrades user plan
- [ ] Pro user has increased limits
- [ ] User can cancel subscription
- [ ] Extension connects to production API

## üîÑ Updating Existing Deployments

### Backend Updates
```bash
# Update code
git pull origin main

# Run tests
npm run test --workspace=backend

# Deploy update
# Railway: git push or railway up
# Render: git push (auto-deploy) or manual trigger
```

### Dashboard Updates
```bash
# Update code
git pull origin main

# Run tests
npm run test --workspace=web

# Deploy update
vercel --prod
# Or push to main branch for auto-deploy
```

### Extension Updates
```bash
# Update code
git pull origin main

# Increment version in manifest.json
# Build new version
npm run build --workspace=extension

# Create ZIP and upload to Chrome Web Store
# Submit for review
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Deployment fails with environment variable error**
- Verify all required variables are set in platform settings
- Check for typos in variable names
- Ensure secrets are properly formatted (no extra spaces)

**Database connection timeout**
- Verify IP allowlist includes deployment platform IPs
- Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
- Confirm connection string format is correct

**OAuth redirect errors**
- Ensure all redirect URIs are registered in Google Cloud Console
- Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches deployment URL exactly
- Check for HTTPS requirement in production

**Stripe webhook not receiving events**
- Confirm webhook endpoint URL is correct
- Verify webhook signing secret matches Stripe dashboard
- Check backend logs for signature validation errors

**Extension can't connect to API**
- Verify API URL in extension build matches backend URL
- Check CORS configuration allows extension origin
- Confirm API is accepting requests (test with curl)
