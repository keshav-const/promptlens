### Developer Account Registration

1. Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
2. Pay $5 registration fee
3. Complete developer profile
4. Agree to terms of service

## Production Build Configuration

### Step 1: Update Environment Variables

Create production environment file:

```bash
cd extension

# Create production environment
cat > .env.production << 'EOF'
# Production Backend API
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.promptlens.app

# Extension ID (will be set after first publish)
VITE_EXTENSION_ID=
EOF
```

### Step 2: Update Manifest.json

Verify production settings in `public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "PromptLens",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Capture and manage your AI prompts from ChatGPT and Google Gemini",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "identity",
    "tabs"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://chatgpt.com/*",
    "https://gemini.google.com/*",
    "https://api.promptlens.app/*"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "https://chatgpt.com/*",
        "https://gemini.google.com/*"
      ],
      "js": ["content.js"],
      "run_at": "document_end"
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/icon-16.png",
      "32": "icons/icon-32.png",
      "48": "icons/icon-48.png",
      "128": "icons/icon-128.png"
    }
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon-16.png",
    "32": "icons/icon-32.png",
    "48": "icons/icon-48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon-128.png"
  },
  "oauth2": {
    "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "scopes": [
      "openid",
      "email",
      "profile"
    ]
  },
  "key": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
}
```

**Important Updates:**
- Update `host_permissions` with production API URL
- Update `oauth2.client_id` with production Google OAuth client ID
- Set appropriate `version` (start with "1.0.0")
- Add `key` field for consistent extension ID (see below)

### Step 3: Generate Extension Key (For Consistent ID)

To maintain the same extension ID across updates:

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -out extension-key.pem

# Generate public key for manifest
openssl rsa -in extension-key.pem -pubout -outform DER | openssl base64 -A

# Copy output to manifest.json "key" field
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security**: Store `extension-key.pem` securely and never commit to version control!

Add to `.gitignore`:
```bash
echo "extension-key.pem" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 4: Update API Configuration

Ensure API calls use production URL:

```typescript
// src/config/api.ts (example)
export const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'https://api.promptlens.app';
```

### Step 5: Remove Development Code

```typescript
// Remove console.log statements
// Remove debug flags
// Remove test/mock data
// Ensure error handling for production
```

## Build Extension Package

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd extension
npm install
```

### Step 2: Run Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck
```

All checks must pass before building.

### Step 3: Build Production Bundle

```bash
# Build with production environment
npm run build

# This creates optimized bundle in dist/ folder
```

### Step 4: Verify Build Output

```bash
cd dist
ls -la

# Should contain:
# - manifest.json
# - background.js
# - content.js
# - popup.html
# - popup.js (or bundled JS)
# - icons/
# - Any other static assets
```

### Step 5: Test Built Extension Locally

1. Open Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select `extension/dist` folder
5. Test extension functionality:
   - Visit ChatGPT and capture a prompt
   - Visit Google Gemini and capture a prompt
   - Open popup and verify UI
   - Test login flow
   - Verify API calls go to production

### Step 6: Create Distribution Package

```bash
cd dist

# Create ZIP file for Chrome Web Store
zip -r promptlens-extension-v1.0.0.zip .

# Move to releases folder
mv promptlens-extension-v1.0.0.zip ../releases/

# Verify ZIP contents
unzip -l ../releases/promptlens-extension-v1.0.0.zip
```

## Chrome Web Store Setup

### Step 1: Access Developer Dashboard

Go to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole

### Step 2: Create New Item

1. Click "New Item" button
2. Upload ZIP file: `promptlens-extension-v1.0.0.zip`
3. Wait for upload to complete
4. You'll be redirected to the item configuration page

### Step 3: Get Extension ID

After upload, note the extension ID:
```
Extension ID: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456
```

**Important**: Update this ID in your configuration:

```bash
# Update extension environment
echo "VITE_EXTENSION_ID=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456" >> .env.production

# Update backend ALLOWED_ORIGINS
# Railway:
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://dashboard.promptlens.app,chrome-extension://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456"

# Render: Update via dashboard
```

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Failed

**Problem**: ZIP file rejected during upload

```bash
# Solutions:

# 1. Verify manifest.json is valid
cat dist/manifest.json | jq .

# 2. Check file structure (manifest.json must be in root)
unzip -l promptlens-v1.0.0.zip | head

# 3. Ensure all referenced files exist
# Check manifest references: icons, scripts, etc.

# 4. Remove unnecessary files
# No source maps, .DS_Store, etc. in production ZIP
```

### Review Rejected

**Problem**: Extension rejected during review

Common reasons and solutions:

```
Reason: "Permissions not justified"
Solution: Provide detailed explanation in permission justification field

Reason: "Privacy policy incomplete"
Solution: Ensure privacy policy covers all data collection clearly

Reason: "Single purpose unclear"
Solution: Clarify one main purpose of extension

Reason: "Misleading functionality"
Solution: Ensure screenshots and description match actual functionality

Reason: "Violates program policies"
Solution: Review Chrome Web Store policies and address violations
```

### Extension Not Loading After Install

**Problem**: Users report extension doesn't work after install

```bash
# Solutions:

# 1. Verify API URL is correct in production build
# Should be: https://api.promptlens.app

# 2. Check CORS configuration allows extension origin
# Backend ALLOWED_ORIGINS should include:
# chrome-extension://[extension-id]

# 3. Verify OAuth client ID is correct
# manifest.json oauth2.client_id should match production credentials

# 4. Check content script matches
# manifest.json matches should include target websites

# 5. Review extension errors
# Chrome ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Errors
```

### API Calls Failing

**Problem**: Extension can't connect to backend

```bash
# Solutions:

# 1. Verify API_BASE_URL in build
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL)
# Should output: https://api.promptlens.app

# 2. Test API directly
curl https://api.promptlens.app/health

# 3. Check CORS in backend logs
# Should allow: chrome-extension://[id]

# 4. Verify SSL certificate valid
# Chrome won't allow requests to invalid HTTPS
```

### OAuth Not Working

**Problem**: Google login fails in extension

```bash
# Solutions:

# 1. Verify oauth2 configuration in manifest.json
# client_id should match Google Cloud Console

# 2. Add extension origin to Google OAuth consent screen
# Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Credentials ‚Üí OAuth consent screen
# Add: chrome-extension://[extension-id]

# 3. Check identity permission
# manifest.json permissions should include "identity"

# 4. Test OAuth flow
# Open popup ‚Üí Click sign in ‚Üí Should redirect to Google
```
